# UFOs Analysis Challenge

## Purpose
Dana will like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, she wants to add filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

### How to filter data?
It is quite easy to analize deeper and specific in the website. But, first of all, we need to know how the website looks:

Then, to start filtering the data, you need to scroll down the website to see the filter search, which is located to the left of the information

Next, in the filter search, you must type the state, country, shape, date, etc., that you´re lookng for. It is important to write the information as it is in the data, which is lower-case, if not, the filter will not be executed. Finally, you just need to hit enter on you keyboard and then the filtered data will appear in your screen!

## Summary

In addition to the fact that the website provides a lot of filters to analyze data, it is important to mention a major drawback,  the information is static, users can´t look for new information until we, as the developers, upload new foundings. 

For further development, we address two recommendations:

- Add a one more date filter to look for dates within a range
- Quit static data to search for new information whenever we want
